  # Required. The SPIFFE trust domain. This must match your cluster's
  # workload identity pool.
  trustDomain: sanjaypujare-2-gke-dev.svc.id.goog

  # Required. The CA service that issues your certificates.

  # Required. The key algorithm to use. Choice of RSA or ECDSA.
  #
  # To maximize compatibility with various TLS stacks, your workloads
  # should use keys of the same family as your root and subordinate CAs.
  #
  # To use RSA, specify configuration such as:
  #   keyAlgorithm:
  #     rsa:
  #       modulusSize: 2048
  #
  # Currently, the only supported ECDSA curves are “P256” and “P384”, and the only
  # supported RSA modulus sizes are 2048, 3072 and 4096.
  keyAlgorithm:
    rsa:
      modulusSize: 4096

  # Optional. Validity duration of issued certificates, in seconds.
  #
  # Defaults to 86400 (1 day) if not specified.
  validityDurationSeconds: 86400

  # Optional. Try to start rotating the certificate once this
  # percentage of validityDurationSeconds is remaining.
  #
  # Defaults to 50 if not specified.
  rotationWindowPercentage: 50
